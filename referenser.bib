  abstract = {In this paper, an on-line deterioration prediction method and residual
	life evaluation are proposed for maintenance of rotating equipment.
	Status of the rotating equipment is inspected by vibration measurement
	and a mathematical model for the deterioration of the equipment is
	derived in order to predict future condition of the rotating equipment.
	For the construction of the deterioration model, outliers in the
	vibration data caused by measurement errors and so on are eliminated
	in order to improve accuracy of the deterioration model. Residual
	life of the rotating equipment is evaluated from the deterioration
	prediction by using the deterioration model. The effectiveness of
	the proposed deterioration prediction method and residual life evaluation
	are assured by actual data of rotating equipment in thermal power
	plants.},
